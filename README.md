# Mondrian-Puzzle
Solution for Mondrian Puzzle in Python Jupyter notebook

Find rectangles that can fit into square of N-sized side. All rectangles must be different from each other (1x2 is the same as 2x1).
The difference between the biggest and the smallest rectangle must be as little as possible.

The task is to find the most optimal solution.

This program works, however it's still in progress:
- not all possible solutions are found
- not always the best solution
